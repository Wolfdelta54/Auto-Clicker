# About Me
My name is Darian Horn and, at the time of posting this, I am currently a Senior in high school. My school does offer multiple programming related course, however, I have already taken most of them and they do not go to far into their respective languages. This was my first attempt at using a custom library, ExecuterService, and Robot so I do not know if there would be any better way of accomplishing an Auto-clicker.
